The candidate will have to write a simple Java server application that will support "telnet"-like connections. There is no need to implement the client side as well since the classic "telnet" application will be used for testing the server.
The server must support multiple concurrent connections and it will have to respond to very basic commands like "ls", "cd", "mkdir", "pwd". It also must be portable across platforms (build time and run time).
The use of the classes that invoke native commands (e.g. Runtime or ProcessBuilder) is not allowed.
The candidate must also pay attention to code formatting, commenting and unit testing.
The deliverable will be a project that can be built with Maven 2.
